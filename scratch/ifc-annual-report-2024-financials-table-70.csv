Credit Risk Rating,Indicative External Rating,Category,Description
CR-1,"AAA, AA+, AA, AA-",Very Strong,An obligor rated CR-1 is the highest rating assigned by IFC. The obligor's ability to meet its financial obligations is very strong.
CR-2,"A+, A, A-",Strong,An obligor rated CR-2 is slightly more susceptible to the negative effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligors rated CR-1. The obligor's ability to meet its financial obligations remains strong.
CR-3,BBB+,Adequate,"An obligor rated CR-3 exhibits an adequate financial profile, even though at a weaker level than ""CR-1"" and ""CR-2""."
CR-4,BBB,Adequate,"An obligor rated CR-4 exhibits an adequate financial profile. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a deterioration of the obligor's ability to meet its financial obligations."
CR-5,BBB-,Adequate,"An obligor rated CR-5, as the lowest of the investment grade ratings, exhibits an adequate financial profile. However, adverse economic conditions and/or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weaker financial profile and a deterioration of the obligor's ability to meet its financial obligations."
CR-6,BB+,Moderate,"An obligor rated CR-6, as the first non-investment grade rating, is less vulnerable to default than other non-investment obligors."
CR-7,BB,Moderate,"An obligor rated CR-7 can face major uncertainties. Exposure to negative business, financial, or economic conditions could lead to the obligor's insufficient financial profile and a deterioration of the obligor's ability to meet its financial obligations."
CR-8,BB-,Moderate,"An obligor rated CR-8 faces major ongoing uncertainties. Exposure to negative business, financial, or economic conditions could lead to the obligor's insufficient financial profile and a deterioration of the obligor's ability to meet its financial obligations."
CR-9,B+,Weak,"An obligor rated CR-9 is less vulnerable to default than obligors rated 'CR-10' or 'CR-11'. Significantly negative business, financial, or economic conditions will likely weaken the obligor's financial profile and ability to meet its financial obligations."
CR-10,B,Weak,"An obligor rated CR-10 is more vulnerable to default than obligors rated 'CR-9' but the obligor still has the capacity to meet its financial obligations. Negative business, financial, or economic conditions will likely weaken the obligor's financial profile and ability to meet its financial obligations."
CR-11,B-,Weak,"An obligor rated CR-11 is more vulnerable to default than obligors rated 'CR-9' or 'CR-10'. The obligor still has the capacity to meet its obligations but slightly negative business, financial, or economic conditions are more likely to weaken the obligor's financial profile and ability to meet its financial obligations than a company rated CR-10."
CR-12,CCC+,Very Weak/ Special Attention,"An obligor rated CR-12 faces significant challenges. While such obligors will likely have some positive characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions. The obligor is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions to meet its financial obligations."
CR-13,CCC,Very Weak/ Substandard,"An obligor rated CR-13 is currently vulnerable to default, and is dependent upon significantly favorable business, financial, and economic conditions to meet its financial obligations. In the event of negative business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is not likely to meet its financial obligations and rescheduling and/or restructuring is likely to be required."
CR-14,CCC-,Extremely Weak/Doubtful,"An obligor rated CR-14 is highly vulnerable to default. It is highly likely that a rescheduling and/or restructuring are required without which a default under IFC's accounting definition would ensue. In some cases, even though default has not occurred yet, cash flow may be insufficient to service debt in full."
CR-15,Worse than CCC- and D,Imminent Default /Default,An obligor rated CR-15 is currently extremely vulnerable to nonpayment and there are indications that the next payment will not be made before meeting IFC's accounting definition of default.
D,,Imminent Default /Default,An obligor rated D is in payment default according to IFC's definition of default.
